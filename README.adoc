* Document title
* Author name
* Whether to include a table of contents (y/n)

=== Available Commands

While writing your document, use the following commands:

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Command |Description |Example

|`-l text`
|Create a bullet point
|`-l This is a bullet point`

|`= level text`

|`= 2 Getting Started`

|`-c title`
|Start a collapsible section
|`-c Installation Guide`

|`end-c`
|End the current collapsible section
|`end-c`

|`-code language`
|Start a code snippet
|`-code java`

|`end-code`
|End the current code snippet
|`end-code`

|`-t`
|Create a table
|`-t`

|`exit`
|Save and exit
|`exit`
|===

=== Heading Levels

The `=` command creates headings of different levels:

* `= 1 Title` creates a level 1 heading (=)
* `= 2 Title` creates a level 2 heading (==)
* `= 3 Title` creates a level 3 heading (===)
* And so on, up to level 6

=== Creating Tables

When you use the `-t` command, you'll be guided through the table creation process:

. Enter the number of columns
. Provide column headers
. Enter data for each row
. Type `end-table` to finish, or choose to add more rows

=== Creating Code Snippets

When you use the `-code` command:

. Specify the language (e.g., java, python, javascript)
. Enter your code line by line
. Type `end-code` when finished

== Output

The application saves your document as `output.adoc` in the current directory. You can open this file with any AsciiDoc viewer or converter to see the formatted result.

== Tips

* You can use multiple commands in sequence to build complex documents
* Collapsible sections can contain any other elements (bullet points, code, tables)
* The document is automatically saved when you exit the application
